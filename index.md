<p class="caption">Virgo is an open-source project for building lightweight, cross-platform agents.</p>

Why a framework for agents?
---------------------------

Once and for all, let's solve the problems everyone encounters whenever building an agent:

* Security
* Reliability
* Cross-platform support
* Efficiency, low-overhead
* Code updates
* Ease of extension with application-specific behaviors

Virgo provides:
---------------

* An extensible, versioned protocol on a redundant, secure connection to at least one controller endpoint
* Packages, build infrastructure, installers, and related goodies for many platforms
* Auto-updating controlled from the endpoint
* Crash capturing and reporting with Google's Breakpad

The core agent is written in C with an embedded [Luvit](http://luvit.io/) runtime. Controller endpoints can be written in any language.
