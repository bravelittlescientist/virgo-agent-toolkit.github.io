## Why a framework for agents?

Once and for all, let's solve the problems everyone encounters whenever building an agent:

- Security
- Reliability
- Cross-platform support
- Efficiency, low-overhead
- Code updates
- Ease of extension with application-specific behaviors

## Virgo provides:

- An extensible, versioned protocol on a redundant, secure connection to at least one controller endpoint
- Packages, build infrastructure, installers, and related goodies for many platforms
- Auto-updating controlled from the endpoint
- Crash capturing and reporting with Google's Breakpad

The core agent is written in C with an embedded [Luvit](http://luvit.io/) runtime. Controller endpoints can be written in any language.
